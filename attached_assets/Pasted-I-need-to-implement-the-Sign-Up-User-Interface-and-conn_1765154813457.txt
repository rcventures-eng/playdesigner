I need to implement the Sign Up User Interface and connect it to our backend registration route.

1. The Component Structure (SignUpModal.tsx) Please create a SignUpModal component (using a standard dialog/modal pattern) that triggers when the user clicks 'Sign Up' in the Top Nav or the 'Create your Account' button in the sidebar.

2. The UI Layout

Style: A centered modal card. Dark theme (bg-slate-900), rounded corners, subtle border (border-white/10), and a shadow.

Header: 'Join RC Football' with subtext 'Design plays, build your playbook, and dominate.'

3. The Form Fields Create a vertical form with the following inputs. Use your best judgment for spacing (gap-4).

Email Address (Required, type="email")

Password (Required, type="password", Min 8 chars)

Confirm Password (Required, type="password")

Validation: If this does not match 'Password', show a red error text immediately and disable the submit button.

First Name (Optional, type="text")

Favorite NFL Team (Optional, Select Dropdown)

Data Source: Please generate a constant array of all 32 NFL teams (City + Name) sorted alphabetically (e.g., 'Arizona Cardinals', 'Atlanta Falcons'... to 'Washington Commanders').

4. The Submission Logic

Action: On submit, validate inputs, then send a POST request to /api/register.

Payload: { email, password, firstName, favoriteTeam }.

Loading State: While waiting for the server, change the 'Create Account' button text to 'Creating...' and disable it to prevent duplicates.

Error Handling: If the server returns an error (e.g., 'Email already exists'), display it in a red alert box at the top of the form.

Success: On success, store the user session/token, close the modal, and show a 'Welcome' toast notification.

5. Integration

Export the SignUpModal and mount it in the main App layout.

Create a global state (or use a prop) to control isSignUpOpen.

Wire up the 'Sign Up' button in TopNav and the large Orange Mega-Button in Sidebar to open this modal (setIsSignUpOpen(true)).

Please output the full code for the SignUpModal and the list of NFL teams.
