Build a "Request a Feature" form for my Football Play Designer app. This form should match the existing visual design of the "Create a Free Account" form (same card styling, input styling, button styling, dark theme).

## Tech Stack Context
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Wouter for routing
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Express backend
- Resend for email

## Form Requirements

**Route:** /request-feature

**Fields:**

1. **User Type** (required)
   - Label: "What kind of user are you?"
   - Type: Select dropdown
   - Options: "Football Parent", "Amateur Coach", "Professional Coach"

2. **Feature Request** (required)
   - Label: "What feature would you like to see that isn't currently available?"
   - Type: Textarea (3-4 rows)
   - Placeholder: "Describe the feature you'd like..."

3. **Use Case** (required)
   - Label: "How would you use this feature if it was built?"
   - Type: Textarea (3-4 rows)
   - Placeholder: "Help us understand your use case..."

**Submit Button:** "Submit Request" (green, matching existing button style)

## Backend Requirements

### Database Storage
Create a new `feature_requests` table in shared/schema.ts:
- id: serial primary key
- userType: text (required)
- featureDescription: text (required)
- useCase: text (required)
- userId: varchar (nullable, references users.id) — associate if user is logged in
- createdAt: timestamp with default now()

### Email Notification
On successful submission, send an email via Resend to ray@raymcarroll.com with:
- Subject: "New Feature Request from [userType]"
- Body: formatted version of all three fields

### API Endpoint
POST /api/feature-requests
- No authentication required
- If user IS logged in (session exists), attach their userId to the record
- Return 201 on success

## Spam Protection (Honeypot)

Add a hidden honeypot field to prevent bot submissions:

**Frontend:**
- Add a text input field named "website" with label "Website"
- Hide it using CSS: position it off-screen or use opacity: 0 with pointer-events: none
- Do NOT use display: none or visibility: hidden (bots detect these)
- Use something like: `className="absolute -left-[9999px]"` or `aria-hidden="true" tabIndex={-1} autoComplete="off" style={{ position: 'absolute', left: '-9999px' }}`

**Backend:**
- If the "website" field contains ANY value, silently reject the submission
- Return 201 success anyway (don't tip off bots that they were caught)
- Do NOT store the submission or send email when honeypot is triggered

## Post-Submit Behavior
- Show success toast/message: "Thanks for your feedback! We review every request."
- Clear the form fields
- Stay on the same page (no redirect)

## File Locations for Reference
- Database schema: shared/schema.ts
- API routes: server/routes.ts
- Email templates: server/resend.ts
- Existing form styling: reference the Create Account / Login forms
