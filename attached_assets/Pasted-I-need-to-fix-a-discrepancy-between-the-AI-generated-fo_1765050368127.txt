I need to fix a discrepancy between the AI-generated formations and my hardcoded presets. The AI is guessing player positions instead of using my exact game formats.

The Strategy: Formations as Data Currently, my player coordinates are locked inside functions like handleLoad5v5. I need to extract them into a shared config so the AI can 'read' the exact starting positions.

Step 1: Update shared/football-config.ts Add a formations object to the config. Please extract the Exact X/Y Coordinates from my current handleLoad5v5 and handleLoad7v7 functions and define them here.

Example Structure (Use my actual values):

TypeScript
export const FOOTBALL_CONFIG = {
  // ... existing colors and field config ...
  formations: {
    "5v5": {
      offense: [
        { label: "C", x: 347, y: 284, color: "blue", shape: "square" }, // Center
        { label: "QB", x: 347, y: 324, color: "black", shape: "circle" }, // QB Shotgun
        { label: "X", x: 100, y: 284, color: "green", shape: "circle" }, // Wide Left
        // ... copy exact coordinates for all 5 players
      ],
      defense: [ /* ... copy exact defensive preset ... */ ]
    },
    "7v7": {
      // ... copy exact 7v7 coordinates
    }
  }
};
Step 2: Update the AI System Prompt (server/routes.ts)

Inject this new FOOTBALL_CONFIG.formations object into the Gemini System Instruction.

Crucial Instruction: Add this specific rule to the prompt:

"If the user specifies a Game Format (e.g., '5-on-5', '7-on-7'), you MUST start with the exact player coordinates defined in FOOTBALL_CONFIG.formations. Do not invent new player positions. Your job is to generate the routes array for these specific players."

Step 3: Refactor the Manual Buttons (PlayDesigner.tsx)

Update the manual '5-on-5 Flag' buttons to load data directly from FOOTBALL_CONFIG.formations["5v5"] instead of using hardcoded numbers inside the component.

Why? This ensures that if I tweak a player's starting position in the config, both the Manual Button and the AI Generator update instantly.

Please implement this refactor to sync the AI's starting positions with my manual presets.
