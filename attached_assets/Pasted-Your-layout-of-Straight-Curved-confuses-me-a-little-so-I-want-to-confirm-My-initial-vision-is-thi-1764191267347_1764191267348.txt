Your layout of Straight | Curved confuses me a little so I want to confirm. My initial vision is this:

Long Press -> Pass, Run or Block show up vertically -> Based on which option is selected, Straight or Curved expands in a horizontal menu, but the layout of Straight, Curved is vertical like this:

Straight
Curved

Then as I hold the click, 2 boxes appear to the right horizontally as "Motion?" and "Make Primary".

Is this what you have been trying to communicate? If not, do you like my version better than what you were suggesting? If not, explain why your version is better so I can weigh the pros and cons.

Decided on cascading menu layout (9 seconds)
Ah, I see! You're describing a traditional cascading menu pattern where each level expands to the right:

┌─────────────┐
│ Pass      → │ ┌──────────┐
│ Run       → │ │ Straight │ → ☐ Motion?
│ Block     → │ │ Curved   │   ☐ Make Primary?
└─────────────┘ └──────────┘

Your version is better. It follows the standard right-click context menu pattern users already know. Each level expands horizontally (to the right), items within each level stack vertically. More intuitive and easier to navigate with a mouse.

My version was trying to be compact with Straight/Curved side-by-side, but that breaks the consistent "expand right" pattern. Your cascading approach is cleaner.

Updated Plan:

22 seconds of work
OK. I think we have a good plan here. Would you recommend that we do this all at once, or should I focus on one task at a time using the new "Fast" build mode? I'm fine to do either and I want to be careful that we don't break anything that will send me into spiral mode.

Decided on incremental task completion (5 seconds)
I'd recommend a hybrid approach:

Task 1 (auto-switch to Select) - Do this first, alone. It's a small, isolated change in one function. Quick win, immediate UX improvement, easy to test. Low risk.

Tasks 2-6 (long-press menu system) - These are interconnected and depend on each other. Doing them one at a time would leave the feature half-built and untestable. Better to do these together as one cohesive feature.
